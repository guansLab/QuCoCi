## experiments:

1. pip install torch-quantum

2. important .py:
- (1)build_noise_models_to_csv.py #build a series of custom noise model and save them in  .csv.
- (2)get_history_noise.py  #get a series of custom noise model from real quantum device backend and save them in .csv.
- (3)noise_injection.py /noise_injection_history_data.py  #main benchimark.  load the .csv(generated by (1)(2) ), set the first line as training noise model and the other lines as testing noise model; record test accuracy in the same .csv. 

calibration_data/  #path for saving noise model (xxx.csv)

3. task: find the rule of accuracy change  as noise changes.
-   (1)run get_history_noise.py  (2) set path in 'noise_injection_history_data.py' as output_path in  'get_history_noise.py' (3)run noise_injection_history_data.py (4)analysis the results.

-   (1) run build_noise_models_to_csv.py  (2) set path in 'noise_injection.py' as output_path in  'build_noise_models_to_csv.py' (3)run noise_injection.py (4)analysis the results.

4. try to change variables and get the result, such as 'backend_name','shifts' ...
